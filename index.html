        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            I'm an experienced frontend developer with 4 years of experience in frontend development and 7 years of
            overall development experience. I have strong architecture thinking and OOP knowledge, which allows me
            to create maintainable and scalable code. I have a keen eye for design and usability, and I'm
            experienced in working with design systems and style guides.
        </p>

        <p>
            I firmly believe that the best code is the code that is not written, and the best interface is the one
            that doesn't exist. I prefer lightweight and elegant solutions that are tailored to the task at hand
            without over-engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm a reliable team player and communicator, and I thrive in collaborative environments. I believe that
            effective communication is key to successful teamwork and project delivery. I'm always striving to learn
            and grow as a developer, and I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to improve my
            skills.
